	<h1>What is Mob Psycho 100?</h1>
	<p>Mob Psycho 100 is a story about the titular character 'Mob.' A socially awkward and lonely kid who desires to be popular in his school and confess to his long-time crush, Tsubomi. We follow his story as we witness him meet other powerful espers that he befriends and many others that prove to be enemies rather than friends. As we also see him grow more braver and courageous as a person with many challenges he faces whether that'd be through battles or through interactions with his friends that he grows closer with and many other slice of life shenanigans that he experiences in his city.

			<h3>Shigeo Kageyama</h3>
			<p>Shigeo Kageyama or most well known as his nickname 'Mob,' is the main protagonist of the show. A seemingly awkward and conservative kid that possesses incredibly powerful psychic powers that grow more powerful or weaker based on his emotional capacity.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-9">	
			<h3>Arataka Reigen</h3>
			<p>Reigen Arataka is a part of the mian cast of characters and known better as the mentor of Mob. And in his own words proclaims to be "The Greatest Psychic of the 21st Century." Though even with his insistence and marketing himself to look believable, he seems to be just a fraud that uses Mob to his own advantage for his own job.</p>

			<h3>Kageyama Ritsu</h3>
			<p>Ritsu Kageyama is the brother of Shigeo Kageyama or 'Mob,' a supposedly normal student that slowly unveils and unlocks his own psychic abilities who becomes one of the biggest supporting characters of their story.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-9">
			<h3>Dimple</h3>
			<p>Dimple is an incredibly powerful high-class evil spirit that proves to be exceptional with his abilities than most spirits. Though he'd lose this title immediately once he tackled with espers like Mob that weakened him significantly and possibly permenantly. After their encounter, he becomes a reluctant supporter of Mob and his friends and only helps him for his own gain and survival until he regains his lost power and possibly attain greater strength than before once he seemingly turns on his new buddies.<p>

		<h3>Teruki Hanazawa</h3>
		<p>Teruki Hanazawa, much like Mob is an incredibly powerful esper that seems to be a previous enemy of our protagonist but eventually joins him and helps him to save his brother, Ritsu, after a dangerous duel that seems to have humbled his self-centered and egotistical persona. He becomes an active supporting character of the story that views Mob as his greatest rival.
